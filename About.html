        About</span> Hotel AR</h1>
        <p>AR is a brand known for boutique hotels,
           with each one having its own unique personality.
            The main AR website does a great job of highlighting 
            the uniqueness of each property while staying true to the brand..</p>
          <p>With a lot of very different properties under their brand umbrella,
             AR has found a great way to help guests find the right location
             for their needs. The “search by experience” section breaks properties\
             up into mountain destinations, family destinations, spa destinations, 
             urban destinations, and more. This shows a great focus on the customer 
             and how they want to search for properties..</p>

      <p>"Excellent hotel. Great service
        The room was very spacious, clean, and had the amenities we needed. 
        Breakfast was delicious and with many choices; it was a very wide buffet 
        spread. The people in the reception were very helpful, not just on checkin
        and checkout, but also in giving directions to spots. The location is
        great- very near Central Train Station. I would recommend to friends, 
        and will definitely stay again if Im back in Noida"</p>
